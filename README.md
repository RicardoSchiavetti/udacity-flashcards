# Udacity Flash Cards

This is my final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 

All CSS and HTML were created from scratch to solve this project

This project was developed and tested in Android

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`

From this point you can choose between emulators or your smartphone to run the software
